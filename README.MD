# Refactoring for Accessibility

## Description

In this project, I refactored an exisiting web page by making the web page more accessible.

By doing so, I cleaned up the code. For example, I replaced most of the div elements with semantic elements, such as header, footer, and section. I deleted an unnecessary id selector. I also organized and spread out the code, so it is easier to read.

I also added alt attributes for the images and icons. I changed all the headings to an h1 heading, along with their matching selectors, as each heading did not directly follow each other. I also changed the title of the web page to a more informative title.

I also rearranged the CSS selectors to semantic order, along with adding comments into CSS.

I would have a more unique title, however I learned that we should have a more unique title after making my repo, and changing the name would not be good.
